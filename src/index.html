    <h3>A little about me...</h3>
    <p>As if i hadn't already educated myself out of a job with an
        undergraduate degree from Maryville College in TN in 2011...I
        nevertheless went on to earn my master's degree in Art History
        (with a concentration in museum studies) from The George Washington
        University in 2016. I've interned at The Smithsonian American Art Museum
        and worked at The Phillips Collection in D.C. I moved to the Bay Area
        shortly after graduation and now work at The San Jose Museum of Art.</p>
